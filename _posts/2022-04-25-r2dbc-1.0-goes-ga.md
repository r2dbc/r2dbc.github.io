Dear R2DBC Community,

On behalf of the entire community and everyone who contributed, it is my special honour to announce the general availability of the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity Specification version `1.0.0.RELEASE`.

After 268 tickets and five years of work on the specification, R2DBC finally arrived at a state where we feel confident to publish a 1.0 version of the specification. 
Our previous releases `0.8` and `0.9` helped with incubation and validation of the spec to make sure we're on the right path towards a reliable database connectivity specification.
The huge success in adoption helped us to understand where R2DBC needs to go and it helped to build a community around our efforts. 

Amongst other features, the specification contains the following highlighted features:

* Driver SPI and TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit)
* Integration with BLOB and CLOB types
* Extensible Transaction Definitions
* Plain and Parameterized Statements („Prepared Statements“)
* Support for Stored Procedures/Server Side Functions along with `IN` and `OUT` Parameter bindings
* Consumption of Update Counts, Rows, and Stored Procedure Results
* Batch operations
* Categorized Exceptions
* ServiceLoader-based Driver Discovery
* Connection URL scheme
* Programmatic Configuration API

Special thanks go to the driver and implementor community for your discussions and help without whom it wouldn't be possible to achieve a stable 1.0 specification state.

The previous `0.8` and `0.9` releases were accompanied with a release train BOM (Bill of Materials) for easier consumption. 
With the 1.0 release we no longer maintain a bill of materials to decouple specification development and to enable implementors to ship drivers and R2DBC libraries on their own pace.
The 1.0 release defines a stable state for the foreseeable future and we expect driver vendors to upgrade to R2DBC 1.0 throughout the year. 

This change in the release strategy removes the need to maintain an additional release train.
